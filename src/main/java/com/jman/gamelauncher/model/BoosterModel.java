 * Represents an abstract booster in the Snake game.
 * A booster is a background thread that waits to be activated,
 * applies an effect when consumed, and then returns itself to the booster pool.
 *
 * <p>The booster remains in a waiting state until activated. Once activated,
 * it waits to be consumed, applies its effect, plays a sound, and returns to the pool.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class follows a template method pattern where concrete subclasses
 * define the booster-specific effect and sound in the {@link #run()}
 * method which serves as the template.</p>
