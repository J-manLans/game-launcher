/**
 * TimedEventQueue is a custom implementation of the EventQueue class that measures
 * the time taken to dispatch events. It logs the duration of any event that takes
 * longer than 50 milliseconds to process.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class can be useful for profiling the performance of GUI event handling in
 * Java applications, allowing developers to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It overrides the {@link #dispatchEvent(AWTEvent)} method to calculate the time
 * taken for each event and logs the duration if it exceeds the specified threshold.
